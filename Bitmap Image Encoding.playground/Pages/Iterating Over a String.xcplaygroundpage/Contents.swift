 ## For ... in ... loops
 So from our last page, we have a *string* (that's programmer speak for "a piece of text").
 
 The string is composed of 1's and 0's.
 
 Below, a special type of loop is used.
 
 Run this playground several times.
 
 What do you notice about how this loop operates?
 
 What is *different* compared to our usual *for i in stride(...* type of loop?
 
 What is the *same*?
 
 Be specific.
 
 Type your answer in the code comment.

// Get the encoded bitmap string
let encodedBitmap = getEncodedBitmapString()

// Loop
for character in encodedBitmap {
    print(character)
}


// The syntax for the loop is new.
// For character in encodeBitmap
// for something in somethingElse
//
// I also notice that the loop automatically runs a different number of times each time I run the playground.
// That I'm able to inspect or work with each individual character in the string.
